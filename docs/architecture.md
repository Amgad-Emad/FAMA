# Architecture

## Request lifecycle (web + API share one spine)

```
HTTP → Route (locale group, guard middleware)
     → Controller (thin: validate + orchestrate)
     → Form Request (validation) → DTO (spatie/laravel-data)
     → Service (business logic, DB::transaction, logging)
        └─ Action classes (single discrete operations)
     → Resource (BaseResource) shaped into the JSON envelope
     → response()->success|error|paginated(...)  ← ApiResponse
```

Controllers never contain business logic. They hand a DTO to a service and return a `Response`. The
**same services** back both the web-Ajax controllers and the (future) mobile API controllers, so
behaviour can't drift between the two surfaces.

## Layers & where they live

| Layer | Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Controllers (thin) | `app/Http/Controllers` | Orchestrate only; return the envelope. |
| Form Requests | `app/Http/Requests` | Validation + authorization at the boundary. |
| DTOs | `app/Data` (`BaseData`) | Typed Form Request → Service → Resource contract. |
| Services | `app/Services` (`Service`) | Business logic; `runInTransaction()` wraps multi-write ops with failure logging. |
| Actions | `app/Actions` (`Contracts\Action`) | Single-purpose, invokable operations orchestrated by services. |
| Resources | `app/Http/Resources` (`BaseResource`) | Shape the `data` payload; envelope owns the wrapper. |
| Policies | `app/Policies` (`BasePolicy`) | Own-resource edits + admin override. |
| Enums | `app/Enums` | e.g. `UserRole` (role ⇄ guard source of truth). |
| Support | `app/Support` | `ApiResponse` (envelope), `Auth\Guards` (multi-guard helper). |

## Authentication — three guards

Three login entities, each its own session guard + Eloquent provider (`config/auth.php`):

| Guard | Provider | Model | Table |
|---|---|---|---|
| `admin` (default) | `users` | `App\Models\User` | `users` ✅ migrated |
| `brand` | `brands` | `App\Models\Brand` | `brands` (Phase 1) |
| `talent` | `talents` | `App\Models\Talent` | `talents` (Phase 1A) |

- **Login** is a single, role-aware form: the submitted `role` selects the guard
  (`LoginRequest::role()` → `UserRole`). Absent `role` defaults to `admin` (the only migrated table in
  Phase 0). See `docs/decisions.md` for the open UX decision.
- **Dashboards** are guarded route groups: `auth:admin` → `/admin/dashboard`, `auth:brand` →
  `/brand/dashboard`, `auth:talent` → `/talent/dashboard`. `route('dashboard')` dispatches to the
  active guard's dashboard via `App\Support\Auth\Guards`.
- **Public pages** (home now; talent/brand public profiles in Phase 1) are unguarded.
- **Mobile API** uses Sanctum tokens (`HasApiTokens` on all three models); reserved for Phase 4.

## i18n & RTL

- `mcamara/laravel-localization` wraps all web routes in a locale group (`/en`, `/ar`). The default
  locale (en) is hidden, so `/login` and `/ar/login` both resolve. Middleware aliases are registered in
  `bootstrap/app.php`; the switcher is `x-language-switcher`.
- Arabic is RTL: `<html dir>` is set from the current locale; the UI uses Tailwind **logical**
  utilities (inline-start/inline-end) so layouts mirror automatically.
- `spatie/laravel-translatable` provides per-attribute translations (policy in `docs/conventions.md`).

## Front-end

- Blade + Alpine, Tailwind v4 (via `@tailwindcss/vite`), Vite. Dark mode is the **class** strategy
  (`.dark` on `<html>`, persisted to `localStorage`).
- `resources/js/http.js` is the shared fetch wrapper: it attaches CSRF + `X-Requested-With` +
  `Accept: application/json`, parses the envelope, and throws `ApiError` (with the field error bag) so
  pages surface validation errors without reloading.

## Cross-cutting

- **Logging:** dedicated channels `app`, `auth`, `deals`, `media` (`config/logging.php`). Failure
  convention: catch → log to channel with context → rethrow / return error envelope
  (`Service::runInTransaction`).
- **Transactions:** multi-write operations run through `Service::runInTransaction()` /
  `DB::transaction()`.
- **Strict models:** `preventLazyLoading` + `preventSilentlyDiscardingAttributes` in non-production
  (`AppServiceProvider`).
- **Audit:** `spatie/laravel-activitylog` (table migrated) for admin edits/moderation/overrides.

See `CLAUDE.md` for the full pattern map (which pattern/package backs which part of the domain).
