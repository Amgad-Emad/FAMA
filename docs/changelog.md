# Changelog

Notable changes to the Fama project. Newest first.

## 2026-07-06 — Public pages: profile, case study, reviews, discovery

- **Case-study detail** `GET /{slug}/work/{caseStudy}` (`CaseStudyController` + `public/case-study`
  view) — one `case_studies` record expanded; 404 unless published & owned. Profile case-study cards now
  link here.
- **Public review submission** `GET|POST /{slug}/review` (`PublicReviewController` + `StoreReviewRequest`
  + Alpine form) — writes a pending review (`is_approved = false`); "Leave a review" CTA added to the
  profile header.
- **Discovery / search** (ADR-6 applied, talent side): migration
  `add_discovery_search_indexes` (talents availability/published/city/country, `talent_talent_type.
  talent_type_id`, `equipment.category`, `software_stack.software_name`); `App\Queries\TalentSearch`
  (spatie/laravel-query-builder — filters type/category/availability/city/country/equipment/software/q,
  paginated, eager-loaded); `DiscoveryController` (page + Ajax) + `public/discover` view with the
  `talentSearch` Alpine component; `TalentCardResource`. "Discover" link in the public header.
- **Talent profile** `GET /{slug}` was already live (Phase 1 front-end); confirmed it renders the header
  from `talent_talent_type` (primary leading), visible blocks in position order, bumps `view_count` via
  event, and eager-loads everything (no N+1).
- **Tests green:** 136 passed / 431 assertions (+12) — profile & case-study render (+404s), review
  submission writes pending (+validation/unpublished 404), discovery filters (type/availability/
  location/equipment/software) + pagination. docs/schema.md (indexes) + api.md updated. No git.

## 2026-07-06 — Talent dashboard (talent guard)

- **Full talent dashboard** under `auth:talent` (`routes/talent.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/Talent/*`):
  home (draft/live, view_count, pending reviews, deals slot), profile editor (core fields + reorderable
  blocks + eligibility picker + hero upload), professions manager, block content editors (registry-driven
  controller for gallery/digitals/showreel/equipment/case-studies/software/brand-collabs/looks with
  medialibrary upload), rate card, availability & travel, reviews moderation, affiliations & press, and
  account/settings (slug + publish toggle).
- **Thin controllers → Phase 1B services**; Form Requests (`app/Http/Requests/Talent`) validate,
  Resources (`app/Http/Resources`) shape output, everything returns the JSON envelope. Own-resource
  access enforced (403 on foreign); domain-rule/illegal-transition errors return 422 envelopes
  (`bootstrap/app.php` renders).
- **Front-end**: Blade shells + Alpine (`resources/js/dashboard.js`: `profileEditor`, `professionsManager`,
  `crudList`) on the shared `http.js` wrapper — no page reloads, optimistic drag-reorder, inline
  validation errors, medialibrary uploads with skeleton/loading, dark/light + RTL. New `x-talent-layout`.
- **Tests green:** 124 passed / 400 assertions (+23) — each page's happy path, guest→login, admin
  rejection, ownership 403s, eligibility/duplicate 422s, and a media upload. No git.

## 2026-07-05 — Talent domain logic: block engine, services & state machines

- **Block engine.** Actions `MergeDefaultBlocksForTypes` (merge + de-dupe) and `SeedProfileBlocks`
  (idempotent seeding, Created → Draft). `ProfileBlockService` with an eligibility-aware picker
  (active + universal/by-category/by-type − non-repeatable already present) and add/fill/reorder/
  show-hide/remove; rendering still resolves via `block_type_id` so grandfathered blocks render.
- **Services.** `ProfessionsService` (add/remove types, primary, reorder; seeds missing blocks; blocks
  duplicates) and `TalentProfileService` (core fields, hero, availability, publish/unpublish, rate-card
  CRUD, reviews moderation, affiliations & press). All multi-write ops are `DB::transaction` +
  fail-logged via the service base.
- **State machines** (spatie/laravel-model-states) for 7 lifecycles — talent profile, availability,
  block, review, service, affiliation, portfolio media — with explicit transitions + a guarded `ToLive`
  publish. Added `status` columns (backfilled); the old booleans (`is_published`/`is_visible`/
  `is_approved`/`is_active`/`is_current`) are kept as projections synced by `SyncStateProjections`.
- **Events/listeners** (auto-discovered): `TalentProfileViewed` → view-count; `StateChanged` →
  projection sync + `published_at`; media added → log (media channel); conversion completed → advance
  portfolio media state. Controller now dispatches the view event.
- **Policies:** a talent may only manage its own resources (7 policies via `BasePolicy::owns`).
- **Tests green:** 101 passed / 294 assertions (+32) — every action, service path, and state transition
  incl. illegal ones (`CouldNotPerformTransition`), plus events and policy ownership. No git.

## 2026-07-05 — Design system foundation + live Talent Profile

- **Adopted the Fama design system** (from `public/fama-front`) into the real stack. Ported the design
  tokens (light + `[data-theme='dark']`) into `resources/css/app.css`, mapped them to Tailwind via
  `@theme inline` (theme-aware `bg-surface`/`text-ink`/`bg-accent`/`font-display`/`shadow-e2`…), added
  the Bodoni Moda + IBM Plex Sans/Arabic/Mono fonts, and switched dark mode from the `.dark` class to
  the `data-theme` attribute (layouts, nav toggle, and the `dark:` variant all reconciled).
- **Base UI components** (`resources/views/components/ui/*`): button, card, chip, badge, avatar
  (image/initials), eyebrow, stat, section — token-bound, dark + RTL aware. Plus a public layout,
  `x-theme-toggle`, and a DS locale switcher.
- **Live public Talent Profile** — `GET /{slug}` (`TalentProfileController`) renders a published talent
  (hero, identity header, then `profile_blocks` in order via `talent/blocks/{key}` partials) bound to
  the seeded demo talent. Verified in light, dark, LTR and Arabic/RTL against the running app; missing
  media degrades to gradient/initials placeholders.
- Removed a stray `es` (and duplicate `en`) locale from `config/laravellocalization.php` — supported
  locales are now **en, ar** only.
- **Tests green:** 69 passed / 206 assertions (+4 profile tests: published→200, draft/unknown→404,
  view-count increments). Existing Breeze pages re-themed without breakage. No git.

## 2026-07-05 — Test suite runs on MySQL

- Switched the Pest suite from in-memory SQLite to **MySQL** against a dedicated `fama_test` database
  (`phpunit.xml`: `DB_CONNECTION=mysql`, `DB_DATABASE=fama_test`), so tests exercise the same engine as
  dev/prod and never touch the dev `fama` data. Created `fama_test`. Full suite green (65/200) on MySQL.

## 2026-07-05 — Phase 1A: talent side + block system

- **Migrations** (4 files): `talents` (soft deletes); `talent_types` + `talent_talent_type` pivot; the
  block system (`block_types`, `block_type_category`, `block_type_talent_type`, `profile_blocks`); and
  13 talent content tables (portfolio_items, brand_collabs, reviews, services, comp_cards[1:1],
  look_types, digitals, showreels, equipment, case_studies, software_stack, agency_affiliations,
  press_features).
- **Models** (18): full `Talent` (SoftDeletes + HasMedia + HasTranslations, slug auto-gen), TalentType,
  BlockType, BlockTypeCategory, ProfileBlock, and the 13 content models. Relationships both directions,
  casts, sensible default eager-loads (`ProfileBlock` → `blockType`).
- **Media** (ADR-5): uploaded-asset `*_url`/`thumbnail_url` columns dropped and replaced by media-library
  collections + `thumb` conversions + accessors; external links/embeds kept as plain columns (+ new
  `portfolio_items.embed_url`).
- **Translatable** (ADR-7): content fields stored as per-locale JSON; final list recorded in
  `docs/conventions.md`.
- **Factories** for every model + seeders: `TalentTypeSeeder` (six professions), `BlockTypeSeeder`
  (block catalog with category gates), and `TalentDemoSeeder` — a multi-type (model + photographer)
  talent with merged/deduped blocks and populated content, wired into `DatabaseSeeder`.
- **Notes:** profile fields made nullable for progressive onboarding; `Talent` needs an explicit
  `$table` (the inflector leaves "talent" unpluralized); dev DB is MySQL, tests run on in-memory SQLite.
- **Tests green:** 65 passed / 200 assertions (relationships, casts, media collections, translatable,
  soft deletes, pivot uniqueness, demo seeder). Migrations run clean. No git.

## 2026-07-05 — Decision log formalized

- **`docs/decisions.md` rewritten as a lightweight ADR log** (Context / Decision / Status /
  Consequences). Recorded 10 **Accepted** ADRs — multi-guard auth; Services + Actions with one shared
  JSON envelope; state machines for every lifecycle; configurable deal-flow steps (Strategy/Factory,
  snapshotted into `deal_steps`); media library as source of truth for uploads; promoting
  query-critical JSON to pivots/indexed columns for discovery & search; i18n + RTL; quality gates;
  docs/process discipline; and the retained Tailwind v4 toolchain choice.
- Recorded **OPEN** decisions (needs owner) so they surface every session: A) three brand-side user
  modes (product); B) final-payment-leg automation boundary as a `PaymentStepHandler` setting
  (Kanta/billing); C) talent admission flow — self-signup vs admin approval (product); D) web login UX
  (unified role-aware assumed); E) confirm `brand-spec.md` completeness before Phase 2; plus retained
  F) `deals.campaign_id` FK and G) brand/talent password-reset tables.
- No code changes; no git.

## 2026-07-01 — Phase 0: foundation

- **App & packages.** Laravel 13 app with Breeze (Blade + Alpine + Tailwind + Vite, dark mode, Pest).
  Installed & configured: sanctum, spatie medialibrary, model-states, laravel-data, translatable,
  mcamara/laravel-localization, activitylog, query-builder, knuckleswtf/scribe, Pest (+ laravel plugin).
  Published vendor configs/migrations. Ran only vendor/auth migrations (users/sessions, sanctum
  personal_access_tokens, media, activity_log; model-states has none).
- **Multi-guard auth.** Three guards/providers in `config/auth.php` — admin→users, brand→brands,
  talent→talents. Breeze auth adapted into a DRY, guard-aware structure (`UserRole` enum, `Support\Auth\Guards`,
  role-aware `LoginRequest`/`AuthenticatedSessionController`), guarded dashboard groups per entity,
  public pages unguarded. Single role-aware login (recorded as an open decision). Sanctum reserved for
  the mobile API. Added `Brand`/`Talent` Authenticatable stubs (tables land in Phase 1).
- **i18n + RTL.** Locale-prefixed routes (`/en`, `/ar`, default hidden) + `x-language-switcher`;
  middleware aliases registered in `bootstrap/app.php`. `dir`-aware layouts; Tailwind dark mode = class
  strategy. Reconciled the front-end back to Tailwind v4 (Breeze had scaffolded v3).
- **Shared spine.** JSON envelope (`ApiResponse` + `response()->success|error|paginated` macros,
  `meta.pagination`); base `Service` (with `runInTransaction` + failure logging), `Action` contract,
  `BaseData`, `BasePolicy`, `BaseResource`; dedicated log channels (app/auth/deals/media); strict models
  in non-production; `resources/js/http.js` fetch wrapper.
- **Docs.** Wrote `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/schema.md`, `docs/api.md`, `docs/conventions.md`,
  `docs/decisions.md`; refreshed `CLAUDE.md` (standing rules + pattern map) and `README.md`.
- **Tests green.** Auth scaffolding + envelope covered by Pest; no git operations.

## 2026-07-01

- **Canonical specs installed.** Added the single source of truth for the data model, pages, workflows, and lifecycles under [`docs/specs/`](specs/):
  - `docs/specs/schema-master.md` — canonical database schema (all tables, columns, constraints, relationships).
  - `docs/specs/talent-spec.md` — talent-side pages, workflows, lifecycles, and the shared deal engine.
  - `docs/specs/brand-spec.md` — brand-side pages, onboarding, workflows, and lifecycles.
  - `docs/specs/README.md` — one-page index and the rule that all schema/feature work must be checked against these specs.
  - Root `CLAUDE.md` updated to point every future session to `docs/specs/` as the canonical reference before building anything.
  - No migrations or application code scaffolded yet — that is Phase 0.
