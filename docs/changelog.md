# Changelog

Notable changes to the Fama project. Newest first.

## 2026-07-05 — Decision log formalized

- **`docs/decisions.md` rewritten as a lightweight ADR log** (Context / Decision / Status /
  Consequences). Recorded 10 **Accepted** ADRs — multi-guard auth; Services + Actions with one shared
  JSON envelope; state machines for every lifecycle; configurable deal-flow steps (Strategy/Factory,
  snapshotted into `deal_steps`); media library as source of truth for uploads; promoting
  query-critical JSON to pivots/indexed columns for discovery & search; i18n + RTL; quality gates;
  docs/process discipline; and the retained Tailwind v4 toolchain choice.
- Recorded **OPEN** decisions (needs owner) so they surface every session: A) three brand-side user
  modes (product); B) final-payment-leg automation boundary as a `PaymentStepHandler` setting
  (Kanta/billing); C) talent admission flow — self-signup vs admin approval (product); D) web login UX
  (unified role-aware assumed); E) confirm `brand-spec.md` completeness before Phase 2; plus retained
  F) `deals.campaign_id` FK and G) brand/talent password-reset tables.
- No code changes; no git.

## 2026-07-01 — Phase 0: foundation

- **App & packages.** Laravel 13 app with Breeze (Blade + Alpine + Tailwind + Vite, dark mode, Pest).
  Installed & configured: sanctum, spatie medialibrary, model-states, laravel-data, translatable,
  mcamara/laravel-localization, activitylog, query-builder, knuckleswtf/scribe, Pest (+ laravel plugin).
  Published vendor configs/migrations. Ran only vendor/auth migrations (users/sessions, sanctum
  personal_access_tokens, media, activity_log; model-states has none).
- **Multi-guard auth.** Three guards/providers in `config/auth.php` — admin→users, brand→brands,
  talent→talents. Breeze auth adapted into a DRY, guard-aware structure (`UserRole` enum, `Support\Auth\Guards`,
  role-aware `LoginRequest`/`AuthenticatedSessionController`), guarded dashboard groups per entity,
  public pages unguarded. Single role-aware login (recorded as an open decision). Sanctum reserved for
  the mobile API. Added `Brand`/`Talent` Authenticatable stubs (tables land in Phase 1).
- **i18n + RTL.** Locale-prefixed routes (`/en`, `/ar`, default hidden) + `x-language-switcher`;
  middleware aliases registered in `bootstrap/app.php`. `dir`-aware layouts; Tailwind dark mode = class
  strategy. Reconciled the front-end back to Tailwind v4 (Breeze had scaffolded v3).
- **Shared spine.** JSON envelope (`ApiResponse` + `response()->success|error|paginated` macros,
  `meta.pagination`); base `Service` (with `runInTransaction` + failure logging), `Action` contract,
  `BaseData`, `BasePolicy`, `BaseResource`; dedicated log channels (app/auth/deals/media); strict models
  in non-production; `resources/js/http.js` fetch wrapper.
- **Docs.** Wrote `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/schema.md`, `docs/api.md`, `docs/conventions.md`,
  `docs/decisions.md`; refreshed `CLAUDE.md` (standing rules + pattern map) and `README.md`.
- **Tests green.** Auth scaffolding + envelope covered by Pest; no git operations.

## 2026-07-01

- **Canonical specs installed.** Added the single source of truth for the data model, pages, workflows, and lifecycles under [`docs/specs/`](specs/):
  - `docs/specs/schema-master.md` — canonical database schema (all tables, columns, constraints, relationships).
  - `docs/specs/talent-spec.md` — talent-side pages, workflows, lifecycles, and the shared deal engine.
  - `docs/specs/brand-spec.md` — brand-side pages, onboarding, workflows, and lifecycles.
  - `docs/specs/README.md` — one-page index and the rule that all schema/feature work must be checked against these specs.
  - Root `CLAUDE.md` updated to point every future session to `docs/specs/` as the canonical reference before building anything.
  - No migrations or application code scaffolded yet — that is Phase 0.
